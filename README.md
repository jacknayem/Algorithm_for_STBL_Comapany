# Automation System to make HP report
Five months I am worked in reporting section in HP product team. Basically we worked on old technique. As a reporter I analysis all of the recorded data of all the quarter and also HP principle team know me that continuously increasing demand of HP product in every year in Bangladesh. That's why we need more time to make report from earlier times.
Now a days it's too much challenging to make a report in weekend day (We have to make report in every week). When we are facing the time complexity every weeks. I realize we need help of automation system. Which is help me to make a report in short time. Than I focus on algorithms who solve that problem.
Finally I make a automated algorithm of this problem in  4 days. Using this system I consumedÂ the 4 hours into less than 7 Seconds (Depend on size of Data). It's mean we can save 4 hours every reporting day. If we convert time into bdt currency. Every month we are saving 19200 bdt in a Quarter. Using this system we can make a report in proper time and saving "POS Timeline" deduction (HP Company policy).
Which is help me to save violation and DPFR deduction (HP Company reporitng policy). Most important is any single person can handle the report without extra labor force.
Last month I used this system which is help me too much.
